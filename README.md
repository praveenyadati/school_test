1.Implemented for Android Phone:
    The application is designed and developed to run on Android smartphones, ensuring compatibility with the Android platform and works in both Portrait and Landscape mode.

2.Kotlin is Primary Language:
    Kotlin is used as the primary programming language for building the application. Its modern features and concise syntax contribute to efficient and maintainable code.

3.Hilt as Dependency Injection:
    Hilt, a dependency injection framework for Android, is employed to manage and inject dependencies throughout the application. This enhances modularity and simplifies the codebase.

4.View Binding:
    View Binding is utilized to replace traditional findViewById calls, providing a type-safe and efficient way to access views within layout files.

5.Retrofit & Coroutines Flow for Background Network Operations:
    Retrofit, a popular networking library, is combined with Coroutines Flow to handle background network operations asynchronously. This ensures smooth and responsive user experiences while fetching and processing data from a remote server.

6.MVVM Architecture:
    The application follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern combined with Clean Architecture principles. This separation of concerns enhances maintainability and testability by organizing code into distinct layers.

7.Written Unit Test Cases for ViewModel and repository:
    Unit test cases are written to validate the correctness of ViewModel and Repository components. These tests ensure that business logic behaves as expected and errors are identified early in the development process.

8.Implemented a List of Employee Screen:
    The application features a screen displaying a list of employees. Each row in the list includes an image, name, and phone number, providing users with essential information about each employee.

9.Screen Can Be Refreshed (Pull to Refresh):
    The list of employees can be refreshed by utilizing the pull-to-refresh gesture. This feature allows users to manually trigger a data update from the remote source.

10.Well Documented for Each and Every Class:
    Each class, method, and component in the application is thoroughly documented using KDoc comments. This documentation explains the purpose, usage, and functionality of each element, making the codebase more understandable for developers.

11.Handled Success, Empty, and Error State:
    Different states of data retrieval are handled gracefully. The application distinguishes between success (data loaded), empty (no data available), and error (data loading failure) states, providing appropriate user feedback for each scenario.
